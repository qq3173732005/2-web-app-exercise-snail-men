An app for users to create an account with a username and profile picture, intended as a “building block” for a larger app that uses information from user accounts. Basically just an app for storing photos with the ability to feature one photo.

Users can create an account, store photos, choose a photo to feature as a profile photo, view old photos and select one to feature, delete photos, and view other users' profiles if given the URL.
